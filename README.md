# .Net Core MVC API with MongoDB and RabbitMQ

## üìå This project was built with:
- ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- Docker for services containerization
- MongoDB for database storage
- RabbitMQ and MassTransit for message-based asynchronous communication
- React for client-side rendering and Bootstrap for layout and styling

This project demonstrates integration between an API, a NoSQL database, and a message queue to enable scalable and decoupled communication between services.
